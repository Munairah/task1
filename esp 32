Steps:
The one step : Plug the ESP32 to your PC or laptob by using micro cable.
The second step : Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager > from the search bar write "esp32" > click on install.
The third step: use Tools > Board > select the name of your ESP32 board.
The fourth step : use Tools > Port and select a COM port available.
The fifth step :following code in arduion editor

  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(1000);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(1000);                       
}
